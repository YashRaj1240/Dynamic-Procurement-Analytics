## Overview

This project utilizes **Power BI** to create a Dynamic Procurement Analytics dashboard, providing a detailed view of procurement activities across different departments, purchase officers, and account types. The dashboard offers insights into purchase order (PO) amounts, savings, vendor performance, and quarterly trends, supporting data-driven decision-making in procurement.

## Project Features

- **Procurement by Purchase Officer**: Visualization of procurement amounts handled by individual purchase officers, highlighting those with high purchase volumes and cost-saving impacts.
  
- **Procurement by Account Type**: Analysis of procurement expenses by categories like Travel & Entertainment, Office & Supplies, and Marketing, allowing for focused expense tracking.
  
- **Domestic vs. International Procurement**: Comparison of procurement volumes by origin (domestic vs. international), aiding in supply chain planning and cost management.
  
- **Quarterly Procurement Trends**: Visualization of procurement activity by quarter, showing seasonal fluctuations in spending.
  
- **Key Influencers Analysis**: Identifies factors influencing PO amounts, such as account type and vendor, helping optimize procurement strategies.

## Visualizations

The Power BI dashboard employs a range of visualizations for clarity and interactivity, including:

- **Top Purchase Officers**: Bar charts showing procurement and savings amounts by purchase officer, helping identify cost-saving contributors.
  
- **Account Type Breakdown**: Pie charts and bar graphs displaying procurement by account type for easy comparison of departmental expenses.
  
- **Quarterly Spending Trends**: Line and column charts illustrating procurement volumes by quarter, showing increases or decreases over time.
  
- **Domestic vs. International Comparison**: Visual comparison of procurement origin, providing insights into sourcing strategies.
  
- **Key Influencers for PO Amount**: Analysis that identifies key factors influencing PO amounts, such as specific account types or vendors.
